# Daniel Silva dos Santos

I'm a fullstack web developer from Brazil with a strong interest in performant, maintainable code and system design.
In my spare time, I explore low-level programming with C/C++ and graphics development.

One of my first meaningful programs was a web scraper for Duolingo, written in Python. That project sparked my curiosity and eventually led me to study Programming Principles and Practice Using C++, which in turn inspired me to pursue a Bachelor's degree in Computer Science.

My passion for computing started early, driven by the rich and immersive worlds of PlayStation 2 games like Black (2006) and God of War II.

I'm currently finishing my Bachelor's degree in Computer Science (expected 2025). Professionally, I work mainly with Java and JavaScript, while continuing to build personal projects in C/C++. I also have a bit of experience with Lua.
